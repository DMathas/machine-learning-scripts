# Machine Learning Classification Pipeline

This repository contains two main scripts that implement a simple machine learning classification algorithm. The first script, loop_main.py, uses basic Python code (except for the math package), while the second script, vec_main.py, utilizes a vectorized implementation with mainly NumPy.

# Scripts Overview:

# 1. LOOP_MAIN_ML_scripts.py
Implements a basic machine learning pipeline with explicit loops.
Uses plain Python code for simplicity.
Includes functions for forward and backward passes, initialization, updating parameters, and training the neural network using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
Provides a demonstration on synthetic data and the MNIST dataset.

# 2. VEC_MAIN_ML_scripts.py
Utilizes a vectorized machine learning pipeline with NumPy for improved performance.
Implements the same functionality as loop_main.py but with vectorized operations.
Showcases experiments on the MNIST dataset, including training with different learning rates and evaluating the model on a canonical test set.

# Additional Notes:

The scripts include functions for forward and backward passes, initialization, updating parameters, and training a simple neural network.
The vectorized implementation uses NumPy for efficient matrix operations, improving computational performance.
Experiments with synthetic data and the MNIST dataset demonstrate the functionality and performance of the implemented algorithms.
